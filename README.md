PracticalMLProject
==================

Project for partial fulfilment of Practical Machine Learning Course on Coursera

The R-markdown and the corresponding HTML file from the R-markdown are included in the gh-pages branch of this repository.

The source of the data for the given problem is http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. The data corresponds to "Weight Lifting Exercises". The objective of the project is to create a model which could accurately predict the ```class``` variable of the dataset depending upon a number of parameters which define the exercise being performed.The project uses Random Forests approach to predict the class variable. Implicit cross validation is done to prevent over-fitting. The accuracy achieved by the model while predicting the test data is approximately 0.99.
